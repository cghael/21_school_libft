# 21school_libft
The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that Iâ€™ll be allowed to use in all other school projects.

The libft project builds on the concepts we learned during the bootcamp.
A library of useful functions that we will be allowed to reuse in most of ours school C
projects this year.
